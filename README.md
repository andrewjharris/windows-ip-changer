# windows-ip-changer
The purpose of this tool is to quickly allow windows users to change their static IP address
to a specified value/subnet/gateway or to enable DHCP.

Currently the script only works with a windows adapter of "Local Area Connection".
The script does not provide your actual IP address, but a default value of a generic class C network setup.
